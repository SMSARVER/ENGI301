Libraries to Install:
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-charlcd
sudo pip3 install Adafruit_BBIO

How to Operate Project:
1) Complete wiring: see hackster page: https://www.hackster.io/samuelmsarver/robot-v-s-human-connect-4-eca0b5
2) Position USB Camera so that the connect 4 board fully fills the camera frame
3) Run main.py

Additional Information:
1) If readboard.py has issues detecting the position of pieces on the board then adjust the parameters in the HoughCircles function for the red, blue, and green circles.
   You can also set debug = True so then you will see all the outputs of the code to see where the algorithm goes wrong.
