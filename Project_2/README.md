Please read me or else:

This directory contains the files (library, board, schematic, manufacturing) for a custom PCB for my Robot V.S. Human Connect 4 Robot. Please learn more about my project here: https://www.hackster.io/samuelmsarver/robot-v-s-human-connect-4-eca0b5

This PCB was made using EAGLE and contains all components for the robot except for the stepper motor and servo motor (which are attatched externally).
